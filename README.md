# **Food Delivery System in Java**

This is a **Food Delivery System** built using Java, where users can create an account, and after entering their mobile number and password, they are redirected to the home page of the delivery service. The data is stored in a database using **JDBC-ODBC connection**.

- **Redirection to Home Page:** Upon successful login (mobile number: `1234567890` and password: `12345`), the user is redirected to the home page of the food delivery system.
- **JDBC-ODBC Connection:** Uses JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) with ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) to interact with the database.
